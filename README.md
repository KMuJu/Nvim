# NEOVIM Config

My custom neovim config

## Folders

- lua/config: Contains config files to allow fast reloading
- lua/custom: Custom implementations of stuff such as select and colorscheme
- lua/plugins: Files with plugins for lazy.nvim to load
- lua/helpers: Old code that helps with stuff. I don't really change anything here :)
- after/ftplugin: Files with custom config for each filetype
- snippets: Used by snippet plugin, but I rarely use it

## Important files

- lua/options.lua
- lua/mappings.lua
- lua/config/cmp.lua and lua/config/lsp.lua - large config files
